# AILL-E
Welcome to AILL-E, a [DALL-E by OpenAI](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) spinoff

AILL-E is a full stack MERN application which utilizes [OpenAI's API](https://platform.openai.com/overview) to generate images made by AI to share with the AILL-E Community. 

The home page displays a community showcase of images generated by the community. If you hover over an image it shows the user that uploaded it and the prompt they used.

Here you can search for images, this will search the prompt of what was used to generate that image. Here's an example searching for "Tokyo".

To create a post, we click on the "Create" button in the top right. Here, we can can provide a name, prompt and generate an image. Once we like the image we generated, we can press "Share with Community" which will post that image on the community forum.

# MERN 
Let's talk about the stack that's used in this project. We're using Mongo, Express, React and Node.

# MongoDB
Mongo is used to store the structure of our Posts. Our Schema is consists of documents in the following structure: Name, Prompt and Photo. To make AILL-E future proof, the photos aren't stored as base 64 encoded but rather just a string URL that points to our Cloudinary photo storage. Here's a screenshot of our Cloudinary photos (some of these aren't showed in the community showcase because they were created prior to being connected to our database).

# Express
Express is used for our servers routing and middleware. Here we see two screenshots. One of the code that defines our two endpoints (along with a dummy home page for our server). The other screenshot is of the server itself.

I also wanted to mention that the dalle endpoint established by Express is the one that will make the request to the OpenAI API. The prompt is passed from the frontend, number of images we want generated is 1, size of 1024x1024 and response format of json.

# React
React is used for our frontend of AILL-E. The main things to point out is that we have two pages (the home page and create post page). We also have a few components that are reused, the Card component (to represent the picture post), FormField component (forms for search bar, name and prompt), and the Loader component to display a loading bar when waiting for the request to OpenAI. We also have a react hook to fetch our server for the posts that we should display. On click of the "generate" button (on the post page) this will call the DALL-E route we talked about above to make the request to OpenAI.

# Node
AILL-E runtime environment used. This includes the creation of the package.json files to include dependencies like tailwindCSS and vite for the frontend & mongoose, nodemon, openai, cloudinary and more on the backend.
